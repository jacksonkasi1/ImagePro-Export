## Generating SSH Keys

To securely authenticate with Hugging Face Spaces, you'll need to generate an SSH key pair.

### Using the `ssh-setup.sh` Script

A streamlined way to generate SSH keys is by using the provided `ssh-setup.sh` script. This script automates the creation of SSH keys and guides you through the setup process.

#### üìÑ `ssh-setup.sh` Script

Create a file named `ssh-setup.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# ssh-setup.sh
# A simple script to generate an SSH key pair for Hugging Face authentication.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
set -e

# Function to display messages in color
function echo_color {
    COLOR=$1
    MESSAGE=$2
    RESET='\033[0m'
    case $COLOR in
        "green")
            COLOR_CODE='\033[0;32m'
            ;;
        "yellow")
            COLOR_CODE='\033[1;33m'
            ;;
        "red")
            COLOR_CODE='\033[0;31m'
            ;;
        *)
            COLOR_CODE='\033[0m'
            ;;
    esac
    echo -e "${COLOR_CODE}${MESSAGE}${RESET}"
}

# Prompt user for email
read -p "Enter your email address for the SSH key: " USER_EMAIL

# Define file paths
KEY_DIR="$HOME/.ssh"
PRIVATE_KEY_FILE="$KEY_DIR/id_ed25519.txt"
PUBLIC_KEY_FILE="$KEY_DIR/id_ed25519.pub.txt"

# Create .ssh directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$KEY_DIR"

# Generate SSH key pair
echo_color "green" "Generating a new SSH key pair..."
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "$USER_EMAIL" -f "$KEY_DIR/id_ed25519" -N ""

# Rename keys to .txt for easier access (optional)
mv "$KEY_DIR/id_ed25519" "$PRIVATE_KEY_FILE"
mv "$KEY_DIR/id_ed25519.pub" "$PUBLIC_KEY_FILE"

echo_color "green" "SSH key pair generated successfully!"
echo
echo_color "yellow" "Private Key: $PRIVATE_KEY_FILE"
echo_color "yellow" "Public Key: $PUBLIC_KEY_FILE"
echo
echo_color "yellow" "IMPORTANT: Keep your private key secure and do not share it."
echo
echo_color "green" "Your public key is ready to be added to Hugging Face."
echo "You can view it using the following command:"
echo
echo_color "yellow" "cat $PUBLIC_KEY_FILE"
echo
echo_color "green" "Next Steps:"
echo "1. Copy the contents of your public key:"
echo_color "yellow" "cat $PUBLIC_KEY_FILE"
echo
echo "2. Log in to your Hugging Face account."
echo "3. Navigate to [Hugging Face SSH Keys](https://huggingface.co/settings/keys)."
echo "4. Click on 'Add SSH Key' and paste your public key."
echo "5. Save the SSH key."
echo
echo_color "green" "Your SSH setup is complete!"
```

#### üìã How to Use the `ssh-setup.sh` Script

1. **Create the Script File:**

   Open your terminal and create a new file named `ssh-setup.sh`:

   ```bash
   touch ssh-setup.sh
   ```

2. **Edit the Script:**

   Open the file in your preferred text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `code`):

   ```bash
   nano ssh-setup.sh
   ```

   Paste the script content provided above into the file, then save and exit.

3. **Make the Script Executable:**

   Modify the script's permissions to make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ssh-setup.sh
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**

   Execute the script by running:

   ```bash
   ./ssh-setup.sh
   ```

   - **Enter Your Email:** When prompted, input the email address you want to associate with the SSH key.

5. **Follow the Instructions:**

   - **View Your Public Key:** After the script runs, it will display the path to your public key. To view and copy it, use:

     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.txt
     ```

   - **Add the Public Key to Hugging Face:**
     1. Log in to your [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/).
     2. Navigate to [SSH Keys Settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/keys).
     3. Click on **"Add SSH Key"**.
     4. **Title:** Give your SSH key a recognizable name (e.g., `GitHub Actions Deploy`).
     5. **Key:** Paste the contents of `id_ed25519.pub.txt` that you copied earlier.
     6. Click **"Add SSH Key"** to save.

6. **Store the Private Key Securely:**

   - The private key is saved as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.txt`. You'll need to add this to your GitHub repository secrets for GitHub Actions.

   - **How to Add to GitHub Secrets:**
     1. **Navigate to Your GitHub Repository:**
        - Go to your repository on GitHub.
     2. **Access Repository Settings:**
        - Click on **"Settings"**.
     3. **Add a New Secret:**
        - Go to **"Secrets and variables"** > **"Actions"**.
        - Click on **"New repository secret"**.
        - **Name:** `HF_SSH_KEY`
        - **Value:** Open `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.txt` with a text editor and copy its contents. Paste it into the **Value** field.
        - Click **"Add secret"**.

## Setting Up GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment to Hugging Face Spaces using SSH authentication.

### üìÑ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

Add the following content to your workflow file:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Hugging Face Space

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy-to-huggingface:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout the code from the GitHub repository
      - name: Checkout the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Set up SSH key
      - name: Set up SSH key
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.4
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.HF_SSH_KEY }}

      # Add Hugging Face Space as a remote named 'space'
      - name: Add Hugging Face remote
        run: |
          git remote add space git@hf.co:spaces/<your_username>/<your_space_name>.git

      # Push the code to Hugging Face Space
      - name: Push to Hugging Face Space
        run: |
          git push --force space main
```

#### üîç **Configuration Details:**

- **Trigger Conditions:**

  - **Push to Main Branch:** The workflow triggers on any push to the `main` branch.
  - **Manual Trigger:** You can also manually trigger the workflow via the GitHub Actions tab.

- **Job Steps:**

  1. **Checkout Repository:**

     - Uses `actions/checkout@v3` to clone your GitHub repository into the workflow runner.

  2. **Set Up SSH Key:**

     - Utilizes `webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.4` to start the SSH agent and add your private SSH key (`HF_SSH_KEY`) from GitHub Secrets.

  3. **Add Hugging Face Remote:**

     - Adds your Hugging Face Space repository as a new remote named `space` using the SSH URL.
     - **Replace `<your_username>` and `<your_space_name>`** with your Hugging Face username and Space name respectively.

  4. **Push to Hugging Face Space:**
     - Force pushes (`--force`) the `main` branch to the `space` remote, deploying your latest code.

## Additional Tips

- **Changing SSH Key File Names:**

  - If you prefer different filenames for your SSH keys, modify the `PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` and `PUBLIC_KEY_FILE` variables in the `ssh-setup.sh` script accordingly.

- **Managing Multiple SSH Keys:**

  - If you have multiple SSH keys, consider using [SSH Config](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/config) to manage different keys for different services.

- **Securing Your SSH Keys:**

  - Ensure that your SSH private key file (`id_ed25519.txt`) has appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access:

    ```bash
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.txt
    ```

- **Regularly Rotate Keys:**
  - For enhanced security, periodically generate new SSH keys and update them in both GitHub Secrets and Hugging Face.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Authentication Failures:**

   - **Issue:** `fatal: Authentication failed`
   - **Solution:** Ensure that the `HF_SSH_KEY` secret is correctly added and that the SSH key is properly associated with your Hugging Face account.

2. **Incorrect Remote URL:**

   - **Issue:** Repository not found or incorrect remote URL.
   - **Solution:** Double-check the remote URL format in your GitHub Actions workflow. It should follow:

     ```
     git@hf.co:spaces/<your_username>/<your_space_name>.git
     ```

3. **Permissions Issues:**

   - **Issue:** Insufficient permissions to push to the Hugging Face Space.
   - **Solution:** Ensure that the SSH key has the necessary permissions and that the Space exists under your Hugging Face account.

4. **SSH Agent Errors:**
   - **Issue:** SSH agent not recognizing the key.
   - **Solution:** Verify that the `webfactory/ssh-agent` action is correctly set up and that the `HF_SSH_KEY` secret contains the valid private key.
